# Algorithms Specialization

This repository contains implementations of algorithms and data structures taught by Professor Tim
Roughgarden (Stanford University) on Coursera. The purpose of this repository is to provide a personal 
learning environment as a self taught programmer and to see textbook algorithms 'live'. However, I would
like to extend opportunities for others to learn from my code and optimize my algorithms through writing
clean code or providing more efficient solutions.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository into your local directory to get the source code.

### Prerequisites

As all the code are written in C++, you will need a C++ compiler, and run the program either from the
command line or an IDE. I recommend [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) for Mac users and
[Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org) for Windows users.

## Running a Program

You can compile and run a program either from the command line or an IDE. For IDE users, import a program
into the IDE and click on *run* on your IDE to start the program. Depending on the program, you will
see different texts displayed to the standard output stream while the program is running. After the
program has finished running, it will exit with a zero code (success).
